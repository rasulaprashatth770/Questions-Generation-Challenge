Here an important distinction may be made between: (a) Target group(s)  are the \ngroup or entity who will be directly positively affected by the project at the Project \npurpose level and (b) Final beneficiaries who are those who benefit from the project in \nthe long term at the level of the society or sector, e.g. \u2015children\u2016 due  to increased \nspending on health and education, \u2015consumers\u2016 due to improved agricultural production \nand marketing\u2016.  \n\uf0d8 Project partners are \u2015those agencies who implement the projects with the support of the \ndonor directly\u2016 (ibid).  \nStakeholders include:  \n\u25a0 User Groups \u2013 people who use the resources or services in an area  \n\u25a0 Interest Groups \u2013 people who have an interest in, an opinion about, or who can affect theuse \nof, a resource or service  \n\u25a0 Beneficiaries  of the project  \n\u25a0 Decision -Makers  \n\u25a0 Those Often Excluded from the decision -making process.  \nStakeholders could belong to one or more of these groups. For example, someone might be auser \nof a handpump (user group), and also involved in the water user association that managesit \n(interest group,  decision -maker).  \nStakeholders are not only those who shout the loudest. Those who are often excluded from \nthedecision -making process due to age, gender or ethnicity are those who are most likely to \nloseout if they are not included in the project planning.  What methods could be used to \nensurethese stakeholders are involved?Stakeholders include the winners and the losers as a result \nof the project. While moststakeholders will benefit from the project, there may be others who \nwill be negatively affectedby the  action taken.  \nStakeholders can be divided into two main types: Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n35 \n Stage 2; Assumptions  \nWe have checked that each objective should lead to the one above using the \u2017If -Then\u2018 test.  \nHowever, we can never be 100% sure that each objective will lead to the next because there  will \nalways be a risk that external factors will affect the li nk.  \nAssumptions reflect our recognition that there are factors beyond our control that are necessary \nfor successful achievement of objectives at all levels of the project. For example, we can control \ngetting up on time, having breakfast and getting to the  bus-stop for ourselves. We cannot control \nthe traffic or ensure that the bus company keeps its buses in good running order. So by \nidentifying our assumptions, we have expanded our original hypothesis statement to include the \nspecific nature of the more im portant uncertainties that could affect that hypothesis . \nHaving once identified the assumptions, we can then try to deal with them in such a way as to \nincrease our probability of success and consequently our confidence in our project design. In the \ncase of  the bus example, we can get up earlier to avoid traffic delays or we could call the bus \ncompany and find out how often their buses break down. If the answer is 80% of the time, we \nmight decide to rent a car!  \nAssumptions are useful not only during the design stage of the project but also during the course \nof the project and its evaluation. Once the project begins, the project manager should monitor the \nassumptions regularly to assess their continuing validity. If he finds that an assumption proves to \nbe invalid, he must take action to rectify the situation. A good project manager monitors \nassumptions regularly so that corrective action can be taken in a timely manner. Assumptions are \nalso important during an eva luation because their examination can provide insight as to why the \nproject has or has not succeeded in achieving its objectives.  \nTo develop useful assumption statements, we ask the question: \u2015What could happen to make this \nassumption invalid?\u2016 For exampl e, if we have a very general assumption such as \u2015equipment \navailable on time\u2016, we would ask: \u2015What could happen to delay the availability of equipment?\u2016 \nThe response might be that there is a likelihood that a dock strike will occur and thus we realize \nwe a re really making the underlying assumption that the dock strike would not occur. We can \nthen follow this with a further question: \u2015What could happen to make the dock strike occur?\u2016 \nSuppose we find that the government is scheduled to sign a contract with th e dock workers\u2018 \nunion two weeks before the project equipment is due to arrive at the port, and there is a Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n31 \n \uf0d8 What will show us we have got there? ( EVIDENCE ) \n\uf0d8 What are the potential problems along the way? ( ASSUMPTIONS ) \nWhy use a log frame?  \nLog frames are useful because they:  \n\uf0d8 help people to organise their thinking  \n\uf0d8 help people to think logically  \n\uf0d8 help identify weaknesses in project design  \n\uf0d8 ensure key indicators are identified from the start of the project so that monitoring and  \nevaluation are easier  \n\uf0d8 ensure that people involved in the project use the same terminology  \n\uf0d8 help people to summarise a project plan on a few sides of paper. This helps them to  \ncommunicate their plan simply with others, although a log frame is no substitute for \nwriting  a full plan.  \nHowev er, the log frame approach does have limitations:  \n\uf076 Project management can become rigid unless the log frame is continually checked and  \nadjusted.  \n\uf076 As the approach involves participation by a number of different stakeholders, good  \nleadership and facilitation s kills are needed to ensure stakeholders understand the \napproach  and actively participate in it.  \n\uf076 Since the approach builds on analysis of a problem, it might not be viewed as appropriate \nin cultures where people do not openly discuss problems.  \n\uf076 The terminolo gy used can be threatening to some stakeholders. The approach itself can \nbe very difficult to understand in some cultures.  \nWho should complete the log frame?  \nWhere possible, the primary stakeholders should be involved in developing the log frame.  It \nshould be developed by the people most closely involved in project implement ation. It is  \npossible that the concept of the log frame will not be easily understood by primary stakeholders.  \nHowever, as the process is as important as the end product, partic ipatory processes could be  used \nto guide stakeholders through the questions and help them to identify some of the project  \ncomponents. Then the log frame table could later be completed by project staff.",

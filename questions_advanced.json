Projects are the \ntemporary assemblage of key personnel designed to accomplish specific objectives with \nidentifiable customers in mind. A project has a beginning and an end. The proj ect team dissolves \nonce the objectives are met. It is fluid and driven by the specific needs of that business. The \nproject approach to managing activities embraces change and complexity.  \nProjects can be defined in many different ways. However, there are s ome traits that all projects \nhave in common. Typically, these traits are used to identify what a project is. The most \ndistinguishing feature is a specific time frame. All projects have a beginning and an end. Many \nefforts are called \u2015projects\u2016 but actually  become programs as they extend indefinitely and cover \nbroader, less specific business objectives. Projects must have a clear, definitive goal or objective. \nThe objective is specific, identifiable, and can be accomplished. A project usually involves \nvaried  activities, which produce quantifiable and qualifiable deliverables that when added \ntogether, accomplish the overall objective.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a temporary process, which has a clearly defined start and end time, a set of \ntasks, and a budget, that is develo ped to accomplish a well -defined goal or objective\u2016.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a temporary effort of sequential activities designed to accomplish a unique \npurpose.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a group of inter -related activities, constrained by time, cost, and scope, \ndesigned to del iver a unique purpose.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service. \nTemporary means that the project has an end date. Unique means that the project\u2018s result \nis different from the results of other functions of the org anization.  \n\uf0d8 \u2015An undertaking that encompasses a set of tasks or activities having a definable starting \npoint and well defined objectives. Usually each task has a planned completion data (due \ndate) and assigned resources\u2016.",

Project management is a \nprocess of leading a team of capable people in planning and implementing a series of related \nactivities that need to be accomplished on a specific date with a limited budget.  \nProject management is the application of knowledge, ski lls, tools, and techniques to project \nactivities in order to meet or exceed stakeholders\u2018 needs and expectations.  \nSuccessful project management is the art of bringing together the tasks, resources and people \nnecessary to accomplish the business goals and objectives within the specified time constraints \nand within the monetary allowance. Projects and Programs are linked directly to the strategic \ngoals and initiatives of the organization supported.  In other words, it provides an organization \nwith powerful to ols that improve the  organization's ability to plan, organize, implement and \ncontrol its activities and the ways  it uses its people and resources.  \nA project is a non -repetitive one -of-a-kind activity normally with discrete time, financial  and \ntechnical per formance goals. Normally a complex effort, usually less than 3 years in  duration and \nit is made up of interrelated tasks performed by various organizations.  \nThe project management tools and principles provide the means for  \n\uf0d8 project breakdown into tasks and sub-tasks  \n\uf0d8 finding interdependencies between the tasks  \n\uf0d8 allocating resources, human and material and smoothing resources  \n\uf0d8 estimation for total project duration and budget  \n\uf0d8 monitoring more efficiently project progress Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n3 \n \u2022 Estimates to be documented for planning, tracking, and controlling the project.  \n\u2022 Commitments that are planned, documented, and agreed to by affected groups.  \n\u2022 Project alternatives, assumptions, and constraints.  \n The planning process includes steps to estimate the size of the project, estimate the technical \nscope of the effort, esti mate the resour ;ces required to complete the project, produce a schedule, \nidentify and assess risks, and negotiate commitments.   Repetition of these steps is necessary to \nestablish the project plan. Typically, several iterations of the planning process ar e performed \nbefore a plan is actually completed.   \nWhat is a Project Plan?  \nA project plan is a formal, approved document that is used to manage \nand control a project.  \n The project plan forms the basis for all management efforts associated with the project.  It is a \ndocument that is also expected to change over time.     \nThe project plan documents the pertinent information associated with the project; it is not a \nverbose  textual document. A template for a project plan is provided in this documentation. The \ninformation associated with the plan evolves as the project moves through its various stages and \nis to be updated as new information unfolds about the project.  \nThe pla nning process consists of the following basic tasks:  \n\uf0d8 Define the technical approach used to solve the problem.  \n\uf0d8 Define and sequence the tasks to be performed and identify all deliverables associated \nwith the project.  \n\uf0d8 Define the dependency relations betwee n tasks.  \n\uf0d8 Estimate the resources required to perform each task.  \n\uf0d8 Schedule all tasks to be performed.  \n\uf0d8 Define a budget for performing the tasks.  \n\uf0d8 Define the organization used to execute the project.  \n\uf0d8 Identify the known risks in executing the project.  \n\uf0d8 Define the process used for ensuring quality.  \n\uf0d8 Define the process used for specifying and controlling requirements.",

Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n9 \n  \nIf everyone is clear on the results and vision of the project then the next important task of a \nproject manager is to make sure that everyone on the project team is working toward these goals. \nThe project manager does this through identifying processes that combine and coordinate the \nskills, resources and qualities of the project team.  \nProcesses often found within a project are:  \n\u2022 Assessment  \n\u2022 Purchasing  \n\u2022 Planning  \n\u2022 Budgeting  \n\u2022 Monitoring  \n\u2022 Reporting  \n\u2022 Evaluating outputs, outcomes, or impact  \n\u2022 Communicating within the project team  \n\u2022 Communicating with stakeholders  \n\u2022 Capacity development  \nA process can be defined as any repeatable set of actions a team decides to perform on a regular \nbasis to make sure something is done in a certain way. A go od process improves the odds of the \nproject being completed. Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n8 \n Identification: To identify what a project will focus on, we need to find out who should benefit \nand what their needs are. A \u2015needs assessment\u2016 will give an overview of community problems. \nA \u2015capacity assessment\u2016 will help identify which problem the project should address .  \nDesign: This involves carrying out further research into the people affected by a problem and \nhow they are affected by it. We also need to consider the risks to the project and how we will \nmeasure the project\u2018s performance.  \nImplementation: During the i mplementation, it is important to monitor and review the progress \nof the project and any outside changes that affect it. The project plans should be adjusted where \nnecessary.  \nEvaluation: Evaluation should be carried out at or after project completion. Eva luation could be \ncarried out a few months or years after the project has finished in order to assess its long -term \nimpact and sustainability.  \nLesson Learning: While the project cycle is a useful way of outlining the stages of a project, it \nhas one drawback : it makes it look as though one tool follows another. In fact, many of the \nplanning tools can be used at any stage of the project.

Both are \nimportant and both need to be monitored.  \nWhy Do We Do Monitoring?  \nWe do monitoring to analyze the current situation, identify problems and find solutions, discover \ntrends and patterns, keep project activities on schedule, measure progress towards objecti ves, \nformulate/revise future goals and objectives, make decisions about human, financial, and \nmaterial resources . Actually, it is a very useful tool for management and provides necessary \ninformation for evaluation.  \nIn other words, monitoring means checkin g how things are going on and comparing actual \nprogress to what is planned .  \nWho Does Monitoring?  \nMonitoring is concerned both with project staff, implementation organization and donors . As \nmentioned above, it is useful for management and project manager or program coordinator \nconducts monitoring on all aspects of the project -budget/finance, materials, staff, activities, \noutputs/results etc. Respected project staff s are also responsible for monitoring staff and tasks \nunder them -for example, finance manager  has to monitor the accountant and cashier as well as \nbudget allocations. At the same time, representatives of donors also conduct monitoring to \nmeasure the progress towards objectives and goal/impact.  \nWhen Do We Do Monitoring?  \nAccording to the desired s chedule of i mplementation of the projects.  e.g. monthly, bi -monthly, \nquarterly Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n48 \n Planning for Monitoring  \nMonitoring plan should be in place before the project starts and its activities must be put in the \ndetailed implementation plan. Therefore, it should be part of your planning process.  \nMonitoring and evaluation should be part of your planning process. It is very difficult to set up \nthe monitoring system when the project is in implementation stage. You must develop indicators. \nWhen you do planning, you will set indicators. These indicator s provide the framework for your \nmonitoring and evaluation system. They tell you what you want to know and the kinds of \ninformation will be useful to collect.  \nWhat do we want to know ? This includes looking at indicators for both internal issues and \nextern al issues.  \nThere are three basic types of monitoring commonly used in development work:  \n1. Management/administration  \n\uf0fc staff/personnel  \n\uf0fc vehicles  \n\uf0fc supplies  \n2. Finance  \n\uf0fc project budget and expenditure  \n\uf0fc staff salaries  \n\uf0fc cash flow analysis  \n3. Project activiti es  \n\uf0fc project inputs \u2013 budget, equipment, key staff needed  \n\uf0fc results of activities \u2013 project outputs/outcomes/impact (using indicators)  \n\uf0fc the way the project is managed  \n\uf0fc situation or context \u2013 policy environment, political situation  \nWhat is Evaluation  \nEvaluation is a systematic and objective assessment of ongoing or completed project. It makes \ncomparison of the outcomes of the project with planned ones. Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n45 \n Chapter Six  \nProject Implementation and Assessment  \n6.1. Project Monitoring and Reviewing  \nRemember to include monitoring and reviewing in the activity planning worksheet. Think about  \nwho will collect the evidence for the indicators and who will analyse it. Identify who will be  \nresponsible for making decisions about changing the project design as a result of lessons learnt.  \nEnsure that stakeholders are involved in  this process.  \nIf the information gathered during project identification and research is not enough to give  \nbaseline data for the indicators that have been identified, then a baseline survey should be  carried \nout before the project implementation starts. T his means that there will be data to  compare \nprogress against. For example, an indicator is \u2017attendance by girls at the primary  school \nincreased by 50%\u2018. For the baseline survey, the number of girls attending the primary  school \nshould be counted. When prog ress is monitored later on, the number of girls attending  school can \nbe counted and then compared with the figures in the baseline survey.  \nMonitoring and evaluation (M&E) is a part of a project cycle and should be designed  during the \nproject development st age. While often thought of as one, they are in fact two  discreet aspects of \nproject implementation.  \nMonitoring is the routine tracking of a project\u2018s activities by measuring on a regular,  ongoing \nbasis whether planned activities are being carried out. A p roject can be monitore d at any level \nsuch as inputs, outputs, and outcomes. The purpose of monitoring will  change from one level to \nanother.

The project objective is defined in terms of scope (or \nrequirements), schedule, and cost.  \n\uf0d8 A project is carried out via a set of interdependent tasks.  \n\uf0d8 A project uses various resources to carry out these tasks.  \n\uf0d8 A project has a definite start date and an expected completion date. The actual \ncompletion date may not always be the same as the expected date.  \nKey Characteristics of Projects ; \n\uf0d8 A project has bou ndaries, so its extent is defined.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a one -time effort, usually requiring finite resources.  \n\uf0d8 There are distinct start and end dates for projects.  \n\uf0d8 You know when you have reached the end of the project.  \nProject Plan  \nProject planning defines the  project activities and end products that will be performed and \ndescribes how the activities will be accomplished. The purpose of project planning is to define \neach major task, estimate the time and resources required, and provide a framework for \nmanagemen t review and control. The project planning activities and goals include defining:  \n\u2022 The specific work to be performed and goals that define and bind the project. Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n8 \n Identification: To identify what a project will focus on, we need to find out who should benefit \nand what their needs are. A \u2015needs assessment\u2016 will give an overview of community problems. \nA \u2015capacity assessment\u2016 will help identify which problem the project should address .  \nDesign: This involves carrying out further research into the people affected by a problem and \nhow they are affected by it. We also need to consider the risks to the project and how we will \nmeasure the project\u2018s performance.  \nImplementation: During the i mplementation, it is important to monitor and review the progress \nof the project and any outside changes that affect it. The project plans should be adjusted where \nnecessary.  \nEvaluation: Evaluation should be carried out at or after project completion. Eva luation could be \ncarried out a few months or years after the project has finished in order to assess its long -term \nimpact and sustainability.  \nLesson Learning: While the project cycle is a useful way of outlining the stages of a project, it \nhas one drawback : it makes it look as though one tool follows another. In fact, many of the \nplanning tools can be used at any stage of the project. They should be repeated throughout the \nproject\u2018s life to ensure that any changes that might affect project  \nPurpose of Projec t Management is to integrate or connect project:  \n\uf076 Purposes \u2013 why we do the project  \n\uf076 People \u2013 who does the project  \n\uf076 Processes \u2013 how we do the project  \nA Project manager\u2018s job is to see that the project team ( People ) is clear about the purpose of the \nproject and the 4  levels of results the team expects to achieve.  \n1.

Project Budget  \nThe purpose of a project budget is to prepare a valid estimate of the costs associated with  the \nperformance of project activities using current assumption. The budget should  provide a \ncomplete picture of the project cost structure, including cost estimates for all of  the inputs and \nresources needed to implement the project. The project budget should also identify all sources of \nrevenue that will be used to fund program activities including both  cash and in -kind \ncontributions. To develop a budget, a project design team should work  together with a finance \nspecialist to make realistic estimates for all p roject expenses. The  project budget should be \ndeveloped in the early stages of project design to ensure that the  proposed interventions are \nfeasible with the existing and anticipated funding. If the project  includes a cost share or leverage \nrequirement, a plan for meeting this requirement shall  also be developed and outlined in the \nbudget notes.",
